# Logi-Reg-Ads-Clicking-Prediction
In this project we will build a simple logistic regression model using the [Ad Click prediction dataset] downloaded from (https://www.kaggle.com/jahnveenarang/cvdcvd-vd).  We will work with some demographic data to predict whether a user purchased something after clicking on an ad or not.
